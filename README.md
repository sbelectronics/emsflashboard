# smbaker's EMS / FLASH board #
## Scott Baker, http://www.smbaker.com ##

This project is an ISA board that can be configured as either a 2 MB Flash Drive or a 2 MB EMS memory board. It's configurable in 512KB increments, from 512KB to 2MB. 

The flash / EMS functionality is determined by the position of JP1 and JP2 on the PCB.

For more information, see READMEs in the EMS and flashbio directories.
